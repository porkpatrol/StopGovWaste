# 1. Obtain a free ProPublica Congress API key at: https://www.propublica.org/datastore/api/propublica-congress-api
# 2. Run this script locally (requires Python 3 and the 'requests' library: pip install requests)
# 3. It will guide you through input and output formatted messages with contact links.
